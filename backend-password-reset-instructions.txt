## Password Reset Link Changes

To fix the issue with users seeing the raw JSON response after clicking password reset links, please make the following changes to the password reset email template:

### Current Problem:
- Reset links currently point directly to the backend API (e.g., `https://api.moondex.nl/password/confirm/{id}/{token}`)
- This returns a raw JSON response like `{"status":"success","message":"Password has been changed successfully"}`
- Users see this raw JSON instead of a user-friendly page

### Requested Change:
Please update the password reset email template to use our frontend URL for the reset link, using the appropriate environment:

**Development Environment:**
```
http://localhost:3000/password-reset/{id}/{token}
```

**Staging Environment (if applicable):**
```
https://staging.moondex.nl/password-reset/{id}/{token}
```

**Production Environment:**
```
https://moondex.nl/password-reset/{id}/{token}
```

Please ensure that the correct URL is used based on the environment from which the email is being sent. For local development testing, the localhost URL should be used.

### Environment Configuration:
The email template should ideally use an environment variable to determine the correct base URL:

```
{{ FRONTEND_BASE_URL }}/password-reset/{id}/{token}
```

Where `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` is set to:
- `http://localhost:3000` for development
- `https://staging.moondex.nl` for staging (if applicable)
- `https://moondex.nl` for production

### Why This Works:
1. We've created a new frontend page at `/password-reset/[id]/[token]` that will:
   - Handle displaying a nice UI to the user
   - Call your backend API to perform the actual password reset
   - Log the user out from all sessions
   - Redirect them to our homepage

2. The backend API will still process the actual password reset, but users won't see the raw JSON response.

### API Changes (Optional):
If possible, you could also modify the backend API to support a `redirect_url` parameter:

```
https://api.moondex.nl/password/confirm/{id}/{token}?redirect_url=http://localhost:3000
```

Then make the API perform an HTTP redirect to the provided URL after processing the password reset, rather than returning a JSON response.

### Implementation Notes:
- This is a temporary solution until the backend can be updated to handle redirects properly
- No changes are needed to the actual password reset logic, just the URL in the email template
- The backend API should continue to work exactly as before

Please let me know when you've made this change so we can test it in the development environment first.
